If youve ever had issues trying to figure out what the afk world gave you or even if you didnt this checker helps
Basically it scans the part of ur screen where drops appear every second once something is there it records it and on exit saves to a txt file 
you will need to keep roblox open and infront for it to read the drops and i reccomend using windowed instead of full screen (f11)
